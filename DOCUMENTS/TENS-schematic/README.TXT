THIS ZIP ARCHIVE CONTAINS DIGITALLY SCANNED JPEG FILES DETAILING THE
SCHEMATICS OF THE T.E.N.S. UNIT FEATURED IN THE AUGUST 1997 ISSUE OF SILICON
CHIP MAGAZINE.

        All files (TENS1-9.jpg) are in the order listed in Silicon Chip
Magazine. To view these files in full detail, make sure that all features in
your picture viewer that "fit" the image to your screen are turned off. The
images are MORE than likely LARGER than your screen so you can see why I
would ask that you turn off those "fitting" options. If the fitting features
in your picture viewing software are turned on, zooming in will probably not
work if you are trying to see words or symbols more closely.
